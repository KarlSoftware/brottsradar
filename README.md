Brottsradar
=======

Our contribution built in 12 hours during Uppsala Hackathon 2013. "Brottsradar" is swedish for crime radar.

Using HTML5's geolocation features and the Brottsplatskartan API we have built a simple crime radar, which calculates the danger of being outside at the current position, in the current timeframe.
